### Transactions and UTXO's

A transaction is made from one address to another, and it consists of inputs and outputs. If you are making a transaction to a friend, the input addresses are of yours, meaning you own the private keys associated with those addresses, and are able to sign the transaction with it. Each input is a reference to a previous transaction where you have received your current funds, they are known as unspent transaction outputs, UTXOs for short. Once they are used as input to a transaction, they can no longer be spent again.

The outputs are your friendâ€™s address, and possibly your own address to receive change, as UTXO inputs has to be spent in its entirety, think of each UTXO as a piece of cash, to spend it you need to give the cashier the entire cash and receive change for it.
